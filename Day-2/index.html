    <p>
      My self <b>Ramchandra Dalvi</b> and I recently graduated with a
      <strong>BSc in Information Technology</strong> from
      <em>Mumbai University</em>. I am really <i>passionate</i> about web
      development, especially the MERN stack. I have been working on personal
      projects to build my skills in
      <u>MongoDB, Express.js, React .js, and Node.js</u>. I'm eager to learn
      more about full-stack development and contribute to a dynamic team.
    </p>

    <p>
      My hobby is <u>playing chess</u>, a game that sharpens my problem-solving
      skills, improves concentration, and enhances my strategic thinking all of
      which are valuable in web development.
